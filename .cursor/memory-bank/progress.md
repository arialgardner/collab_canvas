### PR Status Overview

#### Completed PRs: 0/12
None yet

#### Current PR: #1 - Enhanced Shape System Foundation
**Status:** 🚧 Ready to start  
**Goal:** Extend MVP to support multiple shape types with unified data model

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Clean up existing Firestore rectangles (manual step)
- [ ] Extend types/shapes.ts with BaseShape and all shape interfaces
- [ ] Rename useRectangles.js → useShapes.js
- [ ] Update useShapes to support multiple shape types
- [ ] Add z-index management functions
- [ ] Add z-index normalization function
- [ ] Update useFirestore.js collection references
- [ ] Update CanvasView.vue to use useShapes
- [ ] Verify existing rectangle functionality still works
